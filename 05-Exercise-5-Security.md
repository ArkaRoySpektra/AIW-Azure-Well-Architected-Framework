# Exercise 5: Security


## Overview

**Security** is one of the most important aspects of any architecture. It provides the **Confidentiality**, **Integrity**, **Availability** assurances against deliberate attacks and abuse of your valuable data and systems.

Losing these assurances can negatively affect your business operations and revenue, and your organization's reputation. Cloud architectures can help simplify the complex task of securing an enterprise estate through **specialization** and **shared responsibilities**:

 * **Specialization**: Specialist teams at cloud providers can develop advanced capabilities to operate and secure systems on behalf of organizations. This approach is preferable to numerous organizations individually developing deep expertise on managing and securing common elements.
 
 * **Shared Responsibility Model**: Organizations can reduce focus on activities that aren't core business competencies by shifting these responsibilities to a cloud service. Depending on the specific technology choices, some security protections will be built into the particular service, while addressing others will remain the customer's responsibility. To ensure that proper security controls are provided, organizations must carefully evaluate the services and technology choices.

In this exercise, we will apply security principles to your architecture to protect against attacks on the data and systems.
