# **Overview**

The Azure Well-Architected Framework is a set of guiding tenets that can be used to improve the quality of a workload. The framework consists of five pillars of architectural excellence:

  * Reliability
  * Security
  * Cost Optimization
  * Operational Excellence
  * Performance Efficiency

Incorporating these pillars helps produce a high quality, stable, and efficient cloud architecture:

  * Reliability:	The ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function.
  * Security:	Protecting applications and data from threats.
  * Cost Optimization:	Managing costs to maximize the value delivered.
  * Operational Excellence:	Operations processes that keep a system running in production.
  * Performance Efficiency:	The ability of a system to adapt to changes in load.
