# Exercise 1: Cost Optimization

## Overview

Cost Optimization is the process of managing costs to maximize the value delivered. The **Cost Optimization** pillar provides principles for balancing business goals with budget justification to create a cost-effective workload while avoiding capital-intensive solutions. Cost optimization is about looking at ways to reduce unnecessary expenses and improve operational efficiencies.

The **Cost Optimization** in Well-Architected Assessment is a top-down review of your workload to identify what could be improved in your architecture. In this exercise, we will begin by looking at the costs of the workload as well as the most prevalent pain points and how to address them . 

  * Are there any hidden costs in the current architecture? How can you identify them?
  * Can the current IaaS architecture be more cost-effective? How?
  * How would you keep track of cloud expenditure?
  * What will be the cost impact of your new architecture recommendations?

This will help on the most immediate and direct impact of the recommendations.
