# Exercise 2: Operational-Excellence

## Overview

**Operational excellence** apply reliable, predictable, and automated operations processes to your architecture to keep an application running in production.

It covers the operations and processes that keep an application running in production. Deployments must be reliable and predictable. Automate deployments to reduce the chance of human error. Fast and routine deployment processes won't slow down the release of new features or bug fixes.

In this exercise, we will go through the given architecutre and know more about:

 * How would you optimize App time to market?
 * What would you automate? Does PaaS improve the operations?
 * Would you change anything in the current monitoring set up? Why?
 * What changes would you introduce in the deployment?.
 * Is the architecture prepared for the unexpected and to catch mistakes?
